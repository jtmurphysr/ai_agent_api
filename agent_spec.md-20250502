# AI Assistant Agent Specification

## Overview
This specification outlines an AI Assistant Agent leveraging a semantic vector database (Chroma), memory orchestration (LlamaIndex), and advanced language models (initially GPT-4o via OpenAI, adaptable for future models). The user-facing application will be developed using Flutter and Dart, ensuring seamless multi-platform integration.

## Objectives
- Provide deep, personalized interactions using historical memory.
- Enable scalable semantic retrieval with fast query orchestration.
- Build a flexible architecture to integrate alternative language models seamlessly.
- Ensure cross-platform deployment (mobile, desktop, web).

## Technical Architecture

### Front-end (Client)
- **Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
- **Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web, macOS, Windows, Linux
- **Networking:** REST or gRPC APIs (Dio package for REST)
- **State Management:** Riverpod or Provider
- **Persistent Storage (optional):** Drift (SQLite), Hive

### Backend (Semantic Memory & LLM Orchestration)
- **Semantic Vector Database:** Chroma (PersistentClient)
- **Memory Orchestration:** LlamaIndex (Python)
- **Embedding Model:** OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`
- **Language Model (Initial):** OpenAI GPT-4o API
- **Deployment:** Docker containerized, cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) or local (e.g., Raspberry Pi)

## Backend Components

### 1. Semantic Memory Layer (Chroma)
- Stores conversation chunks as semantic embeddings.
- Efficient semantic retrieval based on similarity search.

### 2. Orchestration Layer (LlamaIndex)
- Query management and orchestration.
- Context-aware retrieval and integration into prompts.
- Flexible indexing for future expansion and additional data sources.

### 3. Language Model Integration
- Initial integration with GPT-4o via OpenAI API.
- Configurable interface for future language models (Anthropic, Google Gemini, local models, etc.).

## Functional Workflow

### User Query Processing
1. User inputs query in Flutter client.
2. Client sends request to backend via REST/gRPC.
3. LlamaIndex receives and orchestrates query.
4. Semantic retrieval from Chroma DB.
5. Context-enriched prompt sent to GPT-4o API.
6. Response returned to Flutter client.

### Memory Management
- Chunking strategy: ~300 words per chunk, with overlap.
- Chunks embedded via OpenAI embeddings.
- Storage in ChromaDB, retrieval orchestrated by LlamaIndex.

### Model Flexibility
- Abstracted API interface allowing seamless swapping of language models.
- Configuration-driven architecture (e.g., environment variables or config files).

## Flutter Client Implementation
- User-friendly, intuitive UI.
- Markdown rendering of responses.
- Optional voice interaction (speech-to-text/text-to-speech).
- Local caching of recent interactions for responsive UX.

## Security and Privacy
- API keys stored securely using environment variables.
- TLS/SSL encryption for client-server communication.
- User-controlled privacy: memory data is private, locally stored, and securely accessed.

## Testing & Validation
- Unit tests and integration tests for backend components.
- Automated tests for semantic retrieval accuracy.
- Continuous integration (CI) for automated testing and deployment.

## Deployment Strategy
- Backend containerized using Docker.
- Cloud deployment via AWS, Azure, or GCP.
- Local deployment option for privacy-focused or edge use-cases (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

## Scalability and Extensibility
- Modular architecture for easy addition of new data sources, APIs, or interaction modes.
- Scalable semantic memory storage via Chroma.
- Flexible LLM orchestration via LlamaIndex, supporting future advancements and new model integrations.

## Next Steps
- Develop MVP integrating Chroma, LlamaIndex, and GPT-4o.
- Prototype Flutter client for basic interaction.
- Validate semantic retrieval effectiveness.
- Expand capabilities incrementally based on feedback and new requirements.
