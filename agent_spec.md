# AI Assistant Agent Specification

## Overview
This specification outlines an AI Assistant Agent leveraging a semantic vector database (Pinecone), memory orchestration (LangChain), and advanced language models (initially GPT-4o via OpenAI, adaptable for future models). The user-facing application will be developed using Flutter and Dart, ensuring seamless multi-platform integration. Additionally, it provides support for custom prompt configurations to personalize interactions.

## Objectives
- Provide deep, personalized interactions using historical memory.
- Enable scalable semantic retrieval with fast query orchestration.
- Build a flexible architecture to integrate alternative language models seamlessly.
- Ensure cross-platform deployment (mobile, desktop, web).
- Support continuous embedding and indexing of new content seamlessly.
- Allow users to configure and customize interaction styles and prompt behavior.

## Technical Architecture

### Front-end (Client)
- **Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
- **Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web, macOS, Windows, Linux
- **Networking:** REST APIs (Dio package for REST)
- **State Management:** Riverpod or Provider
- **Persistent Storage (optional):** Drift (SQLite), Hive

### Backend (Semantic Memory & LLM Orchestration)
- **Semantic Vector Database:** Pinecone (Cloud-managed)
- **Memory Orchestration:** LangChain (Python)
- **Embedding Model:** OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`
- **Language Model (Initial):** OpenAI GPT-4o API
- **Deployment:** Docker containerized, cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP)

## Backend Components

### 1. Semantic Memory Layer (Pinecone)
- Stores conversation chunks as semantic embeddings.
- Efficient semantic retrieval based on similarity search.

### 2. Orchestration Layer (LangChain)
- Query management and orchestration.
- Context-aware retrieval and integration into prompts.
- Continuous embedding pipeline for ingesting and indexing new data dynamically.

### 3. Language Model Integration
- Initial integration with GPT-4o via OpenAI API.
- Configurable interface for future language models (Anthropic, Google Gemini, local models, etc.).

## Functional Workflow

### User Query Processing
1. User inputs query in Flutter client.
2. Client sends request to backend via REST.
3. LangChain receives and orchestrates query.
4. Semantic retrieval from Pinecone DB.
5. Context-enriched prompt sent to GPT-4o API.
6. Response returned to Flutter client.

### Memory Management
- Chunking strategy: ~300 words per chunk, with overlap.
- Chunks embedded via OpenAI embeddings.
- Storage in Pinecone, retrieval orchestrated by LangChain.
- Continuous embedding and indexing pipeline for incoming data (new conversations, user interactions, and knowledge updates).

### Model Flexibility
- Abstracted API interface allowing seamless swapping of language models.
- Configuration-driven architecture (environment variables or configuration files).

## Flutter Client Implementation
- User-friendly, intuitive UI.
- Markdown rendering of responses.
- Optional voice interaction (speech-to-text/text-to-speech).
- Local caching of recent interactions for responsive UX.
- Interface for uploading and managing custom prompt configurations.

## Security and Privacy
- API keys stored securely using environment variables.
- TLS/SSL encryption for client-server communication.
- User-controlled privacy: memory data is private, locally stored, and securely accessed.

## Testing & Validation
- Unit tests and integration tests for backend components.
- Automated tests for semantic retrieval accuracy.
- Continuous integration (CI) for automated testing and deployment.

## Deployment Strategy
- Backend containerized using Docker.
- Cloud deployment via AWS, Azure, or GCP.
- Pinecone managed-cloud semantic vector storage.

## Scalability and Extensibility
- Modular architecture for easy addition of new data sources, APIs, or interaction modes.
- Scalable semantic memory storage via Pinecone.
- Flexible LLM orchestration via LangChain, supporting future advancements and new model integrations.

## Continuous Embedding Pipeline
- Automated embedding of new content as generated or ingested.
- Real-time or scheduled indexing into Pinecone.
- Scalable ingestion infrastructure for high-volume data scenarios.

## Custom Prompt Configuration Feature
- Allow users to upload JSON-based custom prompt configurations.
- Personalize agent behavior based on configuration (tone, role, core identity, anchor phrases, relational model).
- Example configuration provided: "agent.json," demonstrating detailed personalization parameters.
- Dynamic prompt handling by backend, modifying agent responses based on user-uploaded configurations.

## Next Steps
- Develop MVP integrating Pinecone, LangChain, GPT-4o, and custom prompt configurations.
- Prototype Flutter client for basic interaction and prompt customization.
- Validate semantic retrieval effectiveness.
- Establish and validate continuous embedding workflow.
- Expand capabilities incrementally based on feedback and new requirements.
